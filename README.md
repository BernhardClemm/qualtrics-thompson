# Thompson sampling in Qualtrics

## Using Github API to store 

1. Create a Github personal acces token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
2. Create embedded variables in your Qualtrics survey to store data up to this point, and data including the new data point. Let's call these "old_data" and "new_data" respectively
3. Use the "Web Service" feature by Qualtrics to get current data via the Github API (with the GET method). Screenshot below
4. JavaSCript
5. Github API using PUT method
